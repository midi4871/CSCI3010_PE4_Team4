Bruce Valentine was person 1. Michael Dix was person 2.
Our program utilizes a 2d vector to make the board. it displays via iterating through these vectors and printing their contents.
We have a loop that terminates after 9 turns, at whcih point the game is over. 
The loop first displays the board, then takes the turn for each player, then repeats.
to run the code, simply compile TicTacToe.cpp and run the output file ./a.out
